## Version Control with Git

- Before we start
  - Create an account at github.com
  - Partner up with the person next to you


## What is Version Control?

- Tracks **changes** to files
- Any file can be tracked
- Text (.txt, .csv, .py, .c, .R, etc.) works best
  - These allow smart *diff* / *merge* etc.
