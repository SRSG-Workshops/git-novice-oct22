Before we get started, we'll have to do a few things.

Later on in the session, we'll be pairing up to demonstrate how you collaborate using GitHub.
You'll need to create an account there: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).

As your GitHub user name will appear in the URLs of your projects there, it's
best to use a short, clear version of your name if you can.

Then, to avoid interruptions later, try and find someone to partner up with now. 
Don't worry if there's an odd number of people- you can always test collaboration by yourself,
but it's **much** better to learn with a real person.

Finally, we'll download the code that we need for this lesson, using Git on the command line.
Open a terminal on your machine, and enter:
~~~
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/Southampton-RSG/swc-git-novice
~~~
{: .language-bash}

`cd` will move to your home directory, and `git clone` will download a copy of the materials.
Once you're all set up, [we can start the course](index.html).
