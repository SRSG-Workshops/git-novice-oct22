Before we get started, we'll have to do a few things.

Later on in the session, we'll be demonstrating how to share work with collaborators using GitHub. You'll need to create an account there: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).

As your GitHub user name will appear in the URLs of your projects there, it's best to use a short, clear version of your name if you can.

Then, we'll download the code that we need for this lesson, using Git on the command line. Open a terminal on your machine, and enter:
~~~
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/Southampton-RSG/swc-git-novice
~~~
{: .language-bash}

`cd` will move to your home directory, and `git clone` will download a copy of the materials.
Once you're all set up, [we can start the course](index.html).
